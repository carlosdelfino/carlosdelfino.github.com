The MT8870D/MT8870D-1 is a complete DTMF
receiver integrating both the bandsplit filter and digital
decoder functions. The filter section uses switched
capacitor techniques for high and low group filters;
the decoder uses digital counting techniques to detect
and decode all 16 DTMF tone-pairs into a 4-bit code.
